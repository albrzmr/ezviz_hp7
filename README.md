## üõ† Usage

Once set up, you will see:
- A device card for your **EZVIZ HP7/CP7 intercom**.
- Two services exposed:
  - `ezviz_hp7.unlock_door`
  - `ezviz_hp7.unlock_gate`

These can be used in **automations, scripts, and dashboards**.

Example automation:
```yaml
alias: Unlock gate on RFID card
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.rfid_reader
    to: "CARD_1234"
action:
  - service: ezviz_hp7.unlock_gate
    data:
      serial: BE7062577-BE6963574
```

## üöß Limitations

- **Live video streaming** uses the local RTSP feed of the device. The device must be
  reachable on your network and the integration needs to obtain the verification code
  from EZVIZ.
- The integration currently supports **one device per account** (multi-device support planned).
